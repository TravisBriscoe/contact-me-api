# contact-me-api
## API server built in NodeJS (ExpressJS, Form-Data, MailGun.js, Cors packages)

Created an HTTPS API that uses a clientside javascript function to grab data from a form and send it an email using MailGun.js

The form in question is on [TravisBriscoe.ca](https://www.travisbriscoe.ca) ([github](https://github.com/TravisBriscoe/TravisBriscoeCa))
