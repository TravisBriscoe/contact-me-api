# contact-me-api
## Built many months ago, but not commited nor tested entirely.
Uses MailGun.js and ExpressJS in Node to create a running API server whose sole purpose is to allow people to contact me through the form on my website [TravisBriscoe.ca](https://www.travisbriscoe.ca)! ([github](https://github.com/TravisBriscoe/TravisBriscoeCa))
